Don't look for countries in address atm. Not sure how to deal with this, as not everything is included/documented in tags. 
No really good treatment for names. At the moment I am just making the last word into <surname> and the other ones into <given-name>. Has obvious issues with times when you have names like ASDF and QWER. Also no treatment of fullauthors at the moment.
It's complaining about acknowledgements, but the documentation says it's okay? 
says pub-date isn't allowed there. Documentation says it does (http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1d1/n-jt30.html). Doesn't accept string-date, although it really should. 
When I print out <ERROR> as plain text, it sometimes leads to errors. Easily fixable, but it might be  an error we want to keep (potentially put in <ERROR> tags of my own to make sure it always is shown as an error)
