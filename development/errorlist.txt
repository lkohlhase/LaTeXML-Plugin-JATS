These are the substantial errors against the DTD present in Slavas conversion of ?LaTeXML-generated? XML to JATS
1. Using <title> tag in <article-title> . It is not necessary and is called out in the documentation as not to be used (probably just need to add an extra clause for ltx:document/ltx:title or something. 
2. Using <string-date> in <article-meta> . Should be <pub-date> <string-date> ... </string-date></pub-date>  (Maybe only for @role='creation', since it's the publishing date. Only case I ran into so far )
3. Reference section is messed up. Currently it is Reference and then a bunch of mixed citations. It should be:
<reflist> 
	<title> ... </title>
	<reflist>
		<ref id=whatever>
			<mixed-citation/>
		</ref>
	</reflist>
	
	Something close to that anyway
	Also it should be possible to get more information from the XML to use stuff like article-title volume etc.
4. equationarray is currently converted to <disp-formula-group> in all cases. This causes errors, as when <equationarray> is found as a child of  a <theorem> or <proof>, you will get a <statement> containing raw <disp-formula-group>, which is not allowed. To remedy, put a <p> around the <disp-formula-group>. This is valid, as long as the <equationarray> is not contained inside  a <p> of its own (Don't think that's possible). 
5. Similar issue for <display-formula>. In some contexts you aren't allowed to use a <disp-formula> and need to put a <p> wrapper around it. Safest is probably doing this whenever it is contained inside a <p> element.
6. You might want to do more text processing, things like <l:text font="italic"> are a thing. Contact me at kohliderzweite@gmail.com if you want a list of the ones I ran into while testing.
