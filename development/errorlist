These are the substantial errors against the DTD present in Slavas conversion of ?LaTeXML-generated? XML to JATS
1. Using <title> tag in <article-title> . It is not necessary and is called out in the documentation as not to be used (probably just need to add an extra clause for ltx:document/ltx:title or something. 
2. Using <string-date> in <article-meta> . Should be <pub-date> <string-date> ... </string-date></pub-date>  (Maybe only for @role='creation', since it's the publishing date. Only case I ran into so far )
3. Reference section is messed up. Currently it is Reference and then a bunch of mixed citations. It should be:
<reflist> 
	<title> ... </title>
	<reflist>
		<ref id=whatever>
			<mixed-citation/>
		</ref>
	</reflist>
	
	Something close to that anyway
	Also it should be possible to get more information from the XML to use stuff like article-title volume etc.
